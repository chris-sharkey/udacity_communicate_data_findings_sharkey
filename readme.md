# Flight Activity in the Wake of Major Historical Events
## by Chris Sharkey


## Dataset

I pulled two months of flight activity data from the [US Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp). The first month is from September 2001 and the second month is from March of 2020. My reason for focusing on these two months is they were both periods of great upheaval in the airline industry, and I was curious about similarities and differences between the two periods. Since there can are large numbers of flights in the US every month, I kept my data selection to just these two months rather than expanding out to other months. To export my slide deck to html, I used this [template](http://damianavila.github.io/blog/posts/hide-the-input-cells-from-your-ipython-slides.html) by Damian Avila, which was provided by Udacity in this lesson.


## Summary of Findings

The impact of the September 11th attacks on flight activity was much more pronounced than the impact of COVID-19. There was a massive spike in flight cancellations after the attacks. September 12th had no flights at all, and both airlines and airports saw major delays during September 13th to 15th. The affects of COVID-19 on flight activity were much more gradual with cancellations exceeding flights by the end of the month. There was no steep decline, however, in the number of flights like there was in September 2001.


## Key Insights for Presentation

The explanatory analysis will focus on the drop in flights during September 9-15, 2011 and the resulting effects to key airlines and airports. For March 2020, I will focus on the decline in flights during the second half of the month and the effects on those same airlines and airports.
